Parts should be cut out of 6mm MDF - what most US stores sell as 1/4".

Anything from 5.5-7.5mm should work with the screws used; thinner, but
stronger material you can use shorter screws.


The parts can all be lasered in two passes - first the screwholes, then
the perimeter.

On a 100-watt class laser, MDF:
Speed 10-12, power 90-100
