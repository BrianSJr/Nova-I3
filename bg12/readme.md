Landing page for the next Nova Labs Build Group Printer!
<br><br>
The design is an aluminum extrusion frame, with a 300x300x400mm build area.
<br><br>
Using the Einsy Rambo, the machine will be quiet and upgradable, but we'll
probably run the first group as simple printers, letting folks add their
own upgrades.

Instructions will continue to live on the Nova Labs Wiki for this machine:

Instructions!
First print out the endcap-legs - you need 4, for the front and back corners.  They use an onionskin layer on the screwholes, so they can print with no support on the flat side.

Once those are out, take one and attach the rounded corners to the ends of two 500mm 2040 extrusions using 1/2" long 10-24 trilobe screws.  These screws make their own threads, so just turn them in really tight.

From there, find two 2020 beams with two holes drilled through at each end.  The holes are there to let you access screw heads.  You'll need 4 M5 by 8mm button-head screws, and four M5 T-nuts.  Two t-nuts go into the 2040 you just used, and two screwheads into the 2020 by their heads.  they should line up with the holes in the 2020 - lightly tighten.  Then the remaining t-nuts go between the plastic endfoot and the 2020, screwing in.  Tighten the plastic M5 nuts first, then tighten the other two M5s.

Repeat for the other four corners.
