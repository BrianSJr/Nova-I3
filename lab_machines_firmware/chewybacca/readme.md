<h1>Chewybacca!</h1>

Chewybacca is running:
 * MKS 1.4, with a broken E0
 ** To get around this, we map E1 to E0, hence included the pins-.h
 * BLTouch sensor - mark 1 or 2; slightly older than current
 * Original aluminum PCB bed - this will likely need to be replaced in the near future
 * E3D V6 hotend
 * Brass nozzle

ERRATA: E0 is broken.

To BUILD:
Open the /base in platform.io within vscode

To INSTALL:
platform.io can upload firmware as well.
